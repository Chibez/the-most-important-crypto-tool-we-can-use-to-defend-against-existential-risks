the most important crypto tool we can use to defend against existential risks



Critical and elaborative exposure on existential risk and how they can be solved by crypto

Because of accelerating technological progress, humankind may be rapidly approaching a critical phase in its career. In addition to well-known threats such as nuclear holocaust, the prospects of radically transforming technologies like nanotech systems and machine intelligence present us with unprecedented opportunities and risks. Our future, and whether we will have a future at all, may well be determined by how we deal with these challenges. In the case of radically transforming technologies, a better understanding of the transition dynamics from a human to a post-human society is needed. Of particular importance is to know where the pitfalls are: the ways in which things could go terminally wrong. 
Existential risks have a cluster of features that make ordinary risk management ineffective. A final section of this paper discusses several ethical and policy implications.


Classification of existential risks

I will use the following four categories to classify existential risks:
Bangs: Earth-originating intelligent life goes extinct in relatively sudden disaster resulting from either an accident or a deliberate act of destruction.
Crunches: The potential of humankind to develop into posthumanity is permanently thwarted although human life continues in some form.
Shrieks: Some form of posthumanity is attained but it is an extremely narrow band of what is possible and desirable.
Whimpers: A posthuman civilization arises but evolves in a direction that leads gradually but irrevocably to either the complete disappearance of the things we value or to a state where those things are realized to only a minuscule degree of what could have been achieved.
Armed with this taxonomy, we can begin to analyze the most likely scenarios in each category. The definitions will also be clarified as we proceed.

Nuclear holocaust

The US and Russia still have huge stockpiles of nuclear weapons. But would an all-out nuclear war really exterminate humankind? Note that: (i) for there to be an existential risk it suffices that we can’t be sure that it wouldn’t. (ii) The climatic effects of a large nuclear war are not well known (there is the possibility of a nuclear winter). (iii) Future arms races between other nations cannot be ruled out and these could lead to even greater arsenals than those present at the height of the Cold War. The world’s supply of plutonium has been increasing steadily to about two thousand tons, some ten times as much as remains tied up in warheads ([9], p. 26). (iv) Even if some humans survive the short-term effects of a nuclear war, it could lead to the collapse of civilization. A human race living under stone-age conditions may or may not be more resilient to extinction than other animal species.


Keys to solving existential risk in the world


 Carbon Utility Token importance

This new tool is called the Carbon Utility Token (CUT). Its agenda is directed to capture, reduce and stop CO2 from entering our atmosphere using a combination of renewable and carbon capture technologies.
Only when this CO2 is destroyed can CUT be created. This means that CUT has real-world impact that can be measured and authenticated on the blockchain.
Now you can use CUT to offset your own carbon footprint. Whether it’s your lunchtime coffee or a flight to Australia, the exact amount of CO2 that you wish to retire can be done so transparently and connected immutably to a verified carbon offset.
This project aims to give climate action a real value. CUT creates real tangible impact on the planet. It has a value that can be measured in terms of its precise scientific benefits, and can be tracked per gram back to the place of origin for any specific carbon offset.

Working with independent power producers, CUT sources more offsets for the pool as tokens are retired.
Whenever minting takes place each token grows to represent an increased volume of carbon it can: hold, trade or retire from circulation forever.
CUT can only be created from projects where CO2 has already been destroyed. This means you can be certain that your participation has a direct and tangible impact.
We utilize smart contracts to scientifically track and verify CUT. This means we have an immutable audit trail from their place of creation, to the type of green project they came from.

Single. Earth

Single. Earth plans to build a ‘digital twin’ of nature that reveals how much any area of ecological significance in the world absorbs CO2 and retains biodiversity. Using environmental data such as satellite imagery, it aims to build global carbon models on which to base its token marketplace, generating profits through carbon compensations, ‘mining’ a new MERIT token for every 100 kg of CO2 sequestered in a specific forest or biodiverse area.
The MERIT tokens are then used to trade, compensate for a CO2 footprint, or contribute to climate goals (as the token is ‘used up’ and cannot be traded anymore). Companies, organizations, and eventually individuals will be able purchase these tokens and own fractional amounts of natural resources, rewarded with carbon and biodiversity offsets. the market for carbon credits is estimated to be worth more than $50 billion by 2030.
Because of the traceability of blockchain and its link to a tradable token, payment to landowners would be immediate.
The biggest problem with climate change is that people think they can’t change it.
But in the digital age, we know that when people come together around a common goal, they can achieve uncommon results.
For the first time, you can use the power of blockchain technology to offset the carbon footprint of any product or service, no matter how big or small. This is where digital meets physical, to fundamentally change the cycle of carbon on earth. This is power to the people, and a tool to help you change the world.

Cryptography

The word "cryptography" is derived from the Greek kryptos, meaning hidden. 
The prefix "crypt-" means "hidden" or "vault," and the suffix "-graphy" stands for "writing."

Cryptography in Cryptocurrency

Cryptography is often needed to prevent sensitive data from being compromised and stolen by people who are not meant to see it. This data can be military, financial, scientific, mathematical, medical, etc. in origin. There is an incredible amount of reasons why many different people need to keep certain information secret. 
Some information, if exposed to the wrong sources could even be a threat to national security. For example, nuclear launch codes, or the passwords to the entrances to weapons or infection disease holding centers like CDC testing facilities and things of this nature all need to be kept secret to protect national security. Cryptography makes it possible for only the appropriate people to have access to the sensitive information of relevance. 

How Cryptography is used in Cryptocurrency

Cryptocurrencies use cryptography for three main purposes; to secure transactions, to control the creation of additional units, and to verify the transfer of assets. To accomplish all of these things, cryptocurrencies rely on what is called “public key cryptography.”
 
Public Key Cryptography

Public key cryptography involves a user having both a public and a private key. Both are encrypted and are a random assortment of numbers and letters that looks something like this: HUorgIOJin7U9NO0hjmnhnuU65Gh87. These keys tend to be around 30 letters/numbers long. The purpose of the public key is to give people an address to send money to. The purpose of the private key is to unlock the public key in order to receive the money that has been sent. 
In this way, only the person who knows the private key can unlock the public key. To gain a better understanding of how this works, picture a blue metallic mailbox that is often found in public places. Anyone can put mail into these mail boxes, yet only the mail man has the key to unlock the mailbox and remove the mail. Cryptocurrency cryptography works in almost the exact same way. 
Anyone can deposit money to a public key/address (mailbox), but only people with the private key can access the money (mailmen). So, in the world of cryptocurrencies, it is as if everyone has their own mailbox, and key that unlocks the mailbox. This allows people to receive money and access it without other people being able to access the money.
